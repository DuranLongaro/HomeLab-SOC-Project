# Node Preparation

## Initial Setup Steps

On both nodes:

1. Install Ubuntu Server
2. Configure static IP addresses
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Enable SSH access

## Verify IP Configuration

Run on each node:

ip a

Confirm:

- wazuh-collector = 192.168.1.221  
- wazuh-siem = 192.168.1.222

## Test Connectivity

From each node:

ping 192.168.1.221
ping 192.168.1.222

Both nodes must respond successfully before continuing.
